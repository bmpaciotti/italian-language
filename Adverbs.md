# Adverbs

You already know that adjectives modify nouns, and that they agree in
gender and number with the noun they modify. Adverbs, in contrast, are
invariable (their endings donâ€™t change), and they can modify verbs,
adjectives, or other adverbs. **Adverbs indicate <u>how</u> an action is
performed**. Some common adverbs that you already know are bene, male,
and molto.
