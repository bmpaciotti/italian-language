# How to Learn Italian Grammar: 6 Shortcuts 

## 1. Cut Down on Conjugations with Modal Verbs

The most common modal verbs in Italian are potere, dovere and volere
(can, have to and want). These verbs are usually followed by another
verb in the infinitive form.

Imagine that you want to say these three phrases in Italian:

-   “I work on Monday.”

-   “You have Italian lessons on Tuesday.”

-   “We play tennis on Saturday.”

-   This requires three different verbs, all of which are conjugated differently:

    -   Lavoro lunedì. (I work on Monday.)

    -   Fate martedì il corso d’italiano. (You have Italian lessons on Tuesday.)

    -   Giochiamo a tennis sabato. (We play tennis on Saturday.)

If instead, we use the modal verb dovere (have to) before the main verb,
we only need to conjugate the modal verb and can leave the others in the
infinitive:

-   Devo lavorare lunedì. (I have to work on Monday.)

-   Dovete fare martedì il corso d’italiano. (You have to go to your Italian lessons on Tuesday.)

-   Dobbiamo giocare a tennis sabato. (We have to play tennis on Saturday.)

Modals allow for the use of a vast array of verbs without necessarily
knowing how to conjugate them.

## 2. Ask Questions Just by Changing Your Tone of Voice

Italian phrases in the interrogative form don’t change their form or
structure. They look exactly like positive or negative phrases.

The way you make a question while speaking Italian is simply by changing
the tone of your voice so that it rises at the end of a sentence. Che
facile! (How easy!)

We do this in English as well, occasionally, usually to show incredulity
or disbelief. For instance, if you caught your vegetarian friend chowing
down on some steak, you might say: “You’re eating meat!?”

Here are some examples in Italian (the bold words indicate when your
tone should rise):

-   Posso avere un cappuccino? (Can I have a cappuccino?)

-   Dobbiamo fare check-out alle 11:00? (Do we have to check out at 11:00?)

-   È un albergo economico? (Is it a cheap hotel?)

-   È già partito il treno? (Has the train already left?)

While the grammar is easy, you’ll still need to be careful because your
tone can say a lot. Notice that for the last example, if you don’t
change your tone, the phrase will mean “The train has already left,”
which could cause some confusion!

## 3. Don’t Worry About Possessive Adjectives for Body Parts

Speaking about your body is one of the first things you need to do
effectively in a new language. This can seem a bit tricky in Italian,
because mastering possessive adjectives like mio, tuo, suo, nostro… (my,
your, his/hers, ours) is a big challenge.

Luckily, we don’t need to go into that, because possessive adjectives
aren’t used in Italian when referring to the body.

In English, you’d say:

-   “Take my hand.”

-   While in Italian you only need to say:

-   Prendi la mano. (Take the hand.)

-   All you need is the definite article (il, i, la, le, gli, lo \[the\]) and you’re ready to go.

## 4. Focus on Verb Endings Rather Than Pronouns

As noted earlier, Italian grammar is based on the changing of verb
endings. Because the verb changes for each person (io, tu, lui, lei…
\[I, you, he, she…\]), the subject pronoun becomes redundant and can be
dropped.

Let’s take the verb lavorare (to work). The translation of “I work” is
io lavoro, and the translation of “you work” is tu lavori.

See how the verb endings change depending on the person? Because the
verb ending already indicates the person, you can translate “I work”
simply to lavoro and “you work” to lavori.

## 5. Use the Continuous Form for a Simplified Present Tense

The continuous form in Italian is used to say what you’re doing right
now. You can also use the present tense for this, but the continuous is
easier because it employs an auxiliary verb

The continuous form is made by combining the verb stare (to be/stay)
with the gerund form of another verb. For example:

-   Sto mangiando un panino. (I’m eating a sandwich.)

Essentially, once you know how to conjugate stare, you can communicate
with the continuous form using every verb in the language. All you need
is to know how to make the gerund, which is formed (for most verbs) by
cutting off the last three letters (-are, -ire or -ere) and replacing
them with -ando (for verbs ending in -are) or -endo (for verbs ending in
-ire or -ere).

-   Mangiare → Mangiando (to eat → eating)

-   Partire → Partendo (to leave → leaving)

-   Correre → Correndo (to run → running)

Using the continuous form can transform the way you talk about what
you’re doing and open the doors to a simplified version of
conversational Italian. No

## 6. Look for Verbs of Movement in the Past Tense

One of the toughest parts of learning the past tense in Italian is
memorizing when to use avere (to have) versus essere (to be) to form
your sentence. Here are a couple examples:

-   Ho fatto festa. (I had a party.) (“Ho“ is the first person form of avere.)

-   Sono entrato l’aula. (I entered the classroom.) (“Sono” is the first person form of essere.)

So how do we know which verbs form the past tense with avere and which
use essere? Well, <u>one trick is to remember that verbs of movement
normally use essere.</u>

If we look at the previous examples, we see that the verb fare (do/make)
doesn’t describe movement. Therefore, it’s conjugated with avere.
Entrare (enter), by contrast, is a verb that denotes movement, so it’s
conjugated with essere.

Some other common verbs that use essere to form the past tense are
andare (go), partire (leave) and uscire (go out).
